Netflix-GPT ðŸŽ¦
Kudos TO Akshay Saini for teaching this
Created this Project called NetflixGPT. A Netflix clone that provides users with a familiar interface to browse movies. The application is integrated with TMDB to fetch movie details and with Firebase for authentication. Users can watch trailers on YouTube by clicking on a movie. Additionally, there's a section for specialized movie suggestions, where users can search the movies using OpenAI API and get the results.
